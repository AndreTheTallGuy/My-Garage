# My-Garage

* Design and build your first full-stack web application. You and your team will design and build an app using the MVC paradigm and your own server-side API. You will also continue to add to your professional repertoire with testing, continuous integration and linting tools.

## Application

* We used a Node and Express server.

* We a Sequelize database and jawsdb on heroku.

* We utilize both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data, as well as delete data.

* We  deployed the application through Heroku.

* We used MarketCheck api as the new api in our website.

* We build this application with the use of Materialize css framework.

* We Setup the files in MVC format. We used this to connect the front end to the back and be able to communicate with both sides.

* We used Handlebars to dynamicaly create the website and set up all of the reuseable code in the main.handlebars. These included the links to the css, js, Materialize, the navbar and footer.


## Screenshots 
* Our application is made up of only two pages, the Home page and the Garage page.

*  This is how the starting page looks when the user first opens the page:

*  This is the same Home page after a search has been done, Here the user can select which cars to send to their garage by clicking the plus icon:

* This screenshot is of the garage were the user can see the cars that have been added to it:

* Finaly this shows what happens when the user hovers over the car images, and reveals info and a minus icon which deletes the car from the database:
